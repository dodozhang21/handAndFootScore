- Started by using jQuery mobile popup but found out it yet works correctly under Android 4.1 so redid those parts using regular jQuery mobile pages
- Submitted comment to jQuery mobile project http://t.co/d550gsmK

To demonstrate a few failing tests
-- game test -> testHandIds -- demonstrate by taking away the clone
-- hand test -> testGetTotal_text -- demonstrate by taking parseInt out in defaultZero method
